## OK - brief description

This is a simple CLI App in Haskell inspired by the fact that I wanted to Follow Organisations in the same way you can follow Repositories.

It queries the Github GraphQL API and then writes info on the most recently updated Repositories for selected Organisations to a SQLite DB. From where you can presumably perform various kinds of Analysis of the data.

Also available in [Rust](https://github.com/halhenke/GithubOrgRust) if thats your thing.
